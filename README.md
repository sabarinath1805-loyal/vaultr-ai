# Mike

![Mike](docs/assets/link-image.jpg)

Mike (MikeOSS) is an open-source legal AI platform for document review,
drafting, and legal research.

It combines a Next.js frontend, an Express backend, Supabase Auth/Postgres,
and Cloudflare R2-compatible object storage.

## Features

- Chat with legal documents and open matters
- Review documents and apply suggested edits
- Run reusable assistant and tabular-review workflows
- Organize projects, folders, and a document library
- Verify citations and research US case law with CourtListener
- Work from Microsoft Word with the beta task-pane add-in
- Run supported language models locally through Ollama

## Quick start

The included Docker Compose stack runs Mike, Supabase, RustFS object storage,
and local email capture without requiring managed infrastructure.

1. Copy the local environment templates:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```

2. In `backend/.env`, set `DOWNLOAD_SIGNING_SECRET` and
   `USER_API_KEYS_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` to separate values generated with:

   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```

3. Add an Anthropic, Gemini, or OpenAI API key to `backend/.env`, unless you
   plan to use Ollama exclusively.

4. Start the stack:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and create an account.

The bundled credentials and infrastructure are intended for local development
only. See [Local development](docs/local-development.md) for service endpoints,
authentication behavior, Ollama setup, and first-run guidance.

### Telemetry

Error reporting is off by default. Operators can opt in by configuring a
runtime-specific Sentry DSN; blank or unset DSNs keep deployments offline.
Before network transmission, every runtime rebuilds reports from an explicit
allowlist: code locations and line numbers, controlled operation labels,
HTTP method/status and normalized routes, validated correlation IDs, release,
and environment. Client document filenames, document text, raw error and
console messages, request URLs/queries/headers/bodies, user identities, and
breadcrumbs are excluded. Automatic sessions, replay, attachments, traces,
and other non-error payloads are blocked. The same boundary applies to
community and official installations. See the [observability guide](docs/observability.md)
for the exact policy, source-map behavior, and limitations.
To keep reporting off even when a DSN is configured, set `SENTRY_DISABLED=true`
(`NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DISABLED=true` / `REACT_APP_SENTRY_DISABLED=true` for the
browser and add-in builds); to use your own Sentry instead, set the matching
`*_SENTRY_DSN`.

Configured DSNs are public submission addresses; stored error reports are
accessible to authorized Sentry organization members. The guide documents
[public-DSN and opt-in policy](docs/observability.md#public-dsns-and-opt-in-reporting)
(Zulip Desktop, Element Web, and GitLab's distinct Service Ping mechanism),
and [quota protections and remaining limits](docs/observability.md#quota-protection-and-its-limits).

The [Sentry data audit](docs/sentry-data-audit.md) records the original privacy
findings, their fixes, and the current outbound data inventory. Source-map
uploads are separate and send application source code only when operators
configure upload credentials.

## System workflows

Mike's system assistant and tabular-review workflows are maintained in the
[`Open-Legal-Products/mike-workflows`](https://github.com/Open-Legal-Products/mike-workflows)
repository. See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md#system-workflows) for how they are
packaged and synchronized with this application.

## Gmail and Google Calendar

Gmail and Calendar are separate, optional connections in **Settings → Connectors**.
Google SSO never connects them automatically. Choose any permitted Google account
for each service, including a different account from your Mike login. Read access
is the default; write permissions require a separate consent flow, and every
send/edit/delete proposal requires explicit approval of its exact contents.
See [setup, technical approach, limits, and manual acceptance tests](docs/google-workspace.md).
