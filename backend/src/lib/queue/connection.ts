 * a time, which is exactly why `maxRetriesPerRequest: null` is mandatory there.
 * A `commandTimeout` on this connection would abort the blocking read and the
 * worker would spin.
 *
 * PRODUCERS (`getRedisProducerConnection`) want the opposite. Delivery to Redis
 * is best-effort in this codebase — the db_jobs row is the durable record and
 * the poller is the backstop — so a producer command against a Redis that is
 * down must FAIL, fast, rather than sit in ioredis's offline queue waiting for
 * a reconnect that may be hours away. With the worker options, an enqueue on a
 * request thread (chat audit, account deletion, export scheduling) buffers
 * forever and the HTTP request never responds: the "best-effort" try/catch
 * around it never runs, because the promise never settles.

/**
 * The wedged-connection signature, and why replacement is the only cure.
 *
 * With `enableReadyCheck: false`, ioredis marks a connection "ready" straight
 * from the TCP 'connect' event. When the link is flapping (a Redis restart, a
 * Docker/NAT proxy in the middle), a socket can die milliseconds after
 * connecting, and the events can land in this order — captured live:
 *
 *     close          → closeHandler schedules a reconnect
 *     ready (stale)  → status becomes "ready" on the DESTROYED stream
 *
 * The scheduled reconnect then aborts, because ioredis refuses to connect a
 * client whose status says "ready". From here no event will ever fire again:
 * the socket is destroyed, so disconnect() (stream.end()) and even a forced
 * stream.destroy() are no-ops with no 'close' to emit — both were tried live
 * and healed nothing. Every command rejects with "Stream isn't writeable and
 * enableOfflineQueue options is false" until the process restarts; measured:
 * 6+ minutes wedged with a healthy Redis one PING away, every delivery
 * silently riding the 60s poll backstop instead of BullMQ.
 *
 * So: a client whose status claims "ready" while its stream is missing,
 * destroyed, or unwritable is dead beyond recovery, and the fix is to throw
 * the OBJECT away, not to poke its socket. The check is a synchronous pair of
 * property reads, so the getter runs it on every call; consumers that cache
 * anything built on this connection (the BullMQ Queue singletons) must
 * compare identity on each use and rebuild when it changes.
