 * conversion window collide: the second enqueue dedupes into the first job,
 * which is still carrying the FIRST upload's storage key. The queue reports
 * success, the new bytes are never converted, and the PDF the app serves is a
 * rendition of a file the user already replaced. Every upload path mints a

 * distinct content its own job while an honest retry of the SAME content still
