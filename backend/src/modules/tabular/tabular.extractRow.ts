// The single source of truth for extracting one row's cells.
//
// A row is the review grid's unit of work: one document, or a folder of source
// documents whose combined text is extracted together. Both entry points
// delegate here so the extraction loop lives in exactly one place:
//   - the synchronous SSE route (POST /:reviewId/generate) — sink writes SSE
//     frames; the caller finalizes any `missing` columns inline.
//   - the async worker (workers/extractionWorker.ts) — sink publishes over
//     Redis; the caller throws on `missing` so BullMQ retries.
//
// This function owns the DB writes (mark generating, persist done) and the
// row-text loading + single multi-column LLM call. It does NOT decide the
// terminal policy for columns the model failed to return — it reports them via
// `missing` and lets each caller apply its own policy (the sync route resets
// them to "pending" when the run was stopped and "error" otherwise).
//
// GENERATION ISOLATION: every write here is stamped with the caller's
// `generationId` and guarded by it (`.eq("generation_id", generationId)`) —
// the mark-generating write as much as the terminal one, because marking also
// clears `content`. A run whose lease was taken over can therefore never
// clobber the winner's results: its updates simply match no rows. This relies
// on the caller having CLAIMED its cells (stamped generation_id on each one)
// before calling in — `claimCellsForGeneration` in tabular.generateStream.ts,
// used by both the sync and async entry points. See tabular.shared.ts for the
// lease itself.
